         <p>
         A prompt template is a string that contains placeholders for parameters that will be replaced with parameter values before the prompt
         is submitted to the model.
         </p>
         <p>
         A default prompt template is set for each model configured for the Text Summarization AI Service. Individual requests can override the
         default template by including the <code>promptTemplate</code> parameter.
         </p>
         <h3>Prompt Template Parameters</h3>
         <p>
         The following request parameters are automatically injected into the prompt template if the associated placeholder is present:
         <ul>
          <li>input</li>
          <li>system</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
         Models with built-in support for system prompts and chat message history do not need to include <em>system</em> or
         <em>chatContext</em> in the prompt template.
         </p>
         <p>
         Additional parameters can be provided in the <code>parameters</code> map as key-value pairs.
         </p>
