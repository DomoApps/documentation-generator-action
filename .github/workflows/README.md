# Workflows Directory

This directory is intentionally empty.

## Why is this empty?

This repository is a **GitHub Action template**, not a repository that runs workflows itself. The workflow examples are stored in the `examples/` directory for users to copy to their own repositories.

## Where are the example workflows?

Example workflows are located in:
- **Destination repo examples**: `examples/destination-repo/workflows/`
- **Source repo examples**: `examples/source-repo/workflows/`

See [examples/README.md](../../examples/README.md) for setup instructions.

## If you want to add CI/CD workflows for this action repo

You can add workflows here for:
- Testing the action itself (unit tests, integration tests)
- Linting and code quality checks
- Release automation
- Documentation generation

Just make sure they don't conflict with the example workflows that users will copy.
